# Todo List - project

This project is one example of list of tasks where the user can create one list containing the your tasks of day.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development

### `node -v`

When running this command, you will see the version of node that was installed on your computer. If you haven't installed node, go to the website: [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en). You will need to have node installed to run the project.

Node is a command line program, which means that it will run through your computer's terminal.

### `npm -v`

When running this command, you will be able to see what version of **npm** has been installed on your computer.

NPM (node package manager) is the node.js package manager, with NPM you can manage your project's dependencies, access the NPM repository and have access to numerous JavaScript libraries and frameworks, allowing installation/uninstallation of them as well as creating your own public or private modules. The npm is included along with nodeJS.

### Share Repository URL

Now that you already have node and npm installed, you will go to the repository where the project is and click on the < > Code part of Github.

The cloning options will open for you to clone on your machine and run the project.

You will choose in the option on HTTPS and copy the link that is in the field.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Clone the Repository

### `git clone REPOSITORY_URL`

With the url of the repository in hand, you will go to the working directory where you want to place the working copy of your project.

You will open your terminal, open Git bash and run this command with the Repository Url that you copied there from Github.

After running this command, you will have downloaded a complete copy of the repository that is there on Github to your computer, containing all the project files so far.

### Install the dependencies

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you must run this command to install all of the project's dependencies.

This will ensure that all necessary libraries and packages are downloaded and installed.

### Run the project

### `npm start`

When running this command, a new browser tab will open with the project running.

The project will open at this browser url http://localhost:3000/

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
